# CaDTD
* A Cataract Dataset for Tool Detection, includes bounding-box-annotations (VOC format) of surgical tools in 25 cataract surgery videos. 
* There are two types of tool setups. `Setup 1` focuses on the whole tool, including both the head and the handle of a tool. `Setup 2` focuses only on the head of tools.
* The original videos are from [CATARACTS](https://cataracts.grand-challenge.org/Data/) and our bounding-box-annotations are based on [CaDIS](https://cataracts.grand-challenge.org/CaDIS/). 
* The file name of each video frame in CaDTD is correspond to CaDIS for convenience.
